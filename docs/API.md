# HTTP API contract

Proposed v1 routes. Keep OpenAPI and Zod validators in sync when implementation begins.

# 7. HTTP API contract (v1)

API prefix: `/api/v1`. JSON request/response with consistent envelope and UTC ISO 8601 timestamps. Authenticate every private endpoint; resolve and verify tenant membership per request. Server cannot trust `organization_id`, prices, roles, or margins supplied by a browser. Requests may accept an organization selector but must authorize it.

### Example calculation request

```json
{
  "seller_quote_revision_id": "<uuid>",
  "buyer_quote_revision_id": "<uuid>",
  "quantity": { "value": "42.000", "unit": "MT" },
  "fx": {
    "source": "MANUAL_ASSUMPTION",
    "cad_per_usd": "1.360000",
    "observed_at": "2026-10-26T18:00:00Z"
  },
  "costs": [
    { "type": "FREIGHT", "amount": "105.00", "currency": "CAD", "per_unit": "MT_DELIVERED" },
    { "type": "HANDLING_BORDER", "amount": "12.00", "currency": "CAD", "per_unit": "MT_DELIVERED" },
    { "type": "OTHER", "amount": "3.00", "currency": "CAD", "per_unit": "MT_DELIVERED" }
  ],
  "loss_mt": "0.000"
}
```

The quote revision records, NOT caller-submitted arbitrary prices, supply the official economic inputs when referenced by ID. Optional sandbox simulation may accept direct input prices but must clearly label them as `UNVERIFIED_ASSUMPTIONS` and must never attach them to an authoritative quote.

### Example calculation response (with the synthetic fixture)

```json
{
  "calculation_status": "CALCULATED_INDICATIVE",
  "currency": "CAD",
  "quantity_unit": "MT_DELIVERED",
  "delivered_quantity_mt": "42.000",
  "revenue_per_mt": "986.00",
  "acquisition_per_mt": "820.00",
  "incremental_cost_per_mt": "120.00",
  "gross_margin_per_mt": "46.00",
  "scenario_gross_margin": "1932.00",
  "engine_version": "1.0.0",
  "warnings": ["FX_MANUAL_ASSUMPTION", "NO_LOSS_ASSUMED", "NOT_EXECUTED_TRADE"],
  "blocking_errors": []
}
```

Return `422 VALIDATION_FAILED` with typed field errors for malformed/conflicting inputs; `409 QUOTE_CHANGED` when input version is stale; `401` for unauthenticated, `403` for disallowed and `404` for inaccessible records (avoid leaking another tenant's records). Use idempotency keys on state-changing endpoints that may be retried.
